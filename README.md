# Blue Bike Usage In Boston

Bluebikes is a public bike share system with stations located throughout the Greater Boston
area. Users can purchase a monthly or annual membership that offers unlimited rides of up to
30 minutes, or buy one-time-use passes for either a single 30-minute ride or unlimited 2-hour
rides within a 24-hour period (the “adventure pass”). Rides that extend beyond their time limit
incur additional charges. After purchasing a pass or membership, riders use a kiosk or mobile
app to unlock a bike at any station in the system, bike along their desired route, and dock the
bike at any station in the system that has open spaces available. Bluebikes staff occasionally
redistribute bikes across the various docking stations in the city in order to optimize bike and
dock availability.
The Northeastern Student Affairs team is interested in understanding current usage statistics
and trends for the Bluebikes stations closest to campus. The team has identified five stations
(Mass Ave T Station; Northeastern University North Parking Lot; Ruggles T Station; Tremont St
at Northampton St; and Wentworth University) and collected data for all rides originating at or
terminating at these five stations during the month of August. Data captured include ride date,
trip duration in minutes, start and end station information (name, internal station ID, and latitude
and longitude coordinates), the internal ID number of the bike used in the trip, user type
(Subscriber if the user has a membership; Customer if the user purchased a one-time pass) and
the rider’s ZIP code. Student Affairs has asked you to help with some preliminary data analysis
for the rides originating at the stations near campus, which are contained in the file
‘start-data.csv.’
Use RStudio to answer the following questions. Provide your written answers, along with any
relevant tables and charts, in a single PDF file. Any charts or tables included in your report
should be properly labeled and formatted for an audience of company executives. Screenshots
from an R output are not appropriate for this assignment. Additionally, your answers to each
item listed below must be clearly numbered in order to receive full credit. You should also submit
a single .R script file with your code for the analysis. No other file formats will be accepted for
this assignment, and you should submit just one file of each type.
